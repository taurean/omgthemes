          >Apple Vision Pro &amp; Predicting the Evolution of Tech
        </h1>
        <p>
          The announcement of Apple's Vision Pro was bound to get instant
          attention. What's interested me since wasn't just the product itself,
          but the way everyone has responded with predictions. The future of
          tech is always near impossible to predict, but it's easy to get drawn
          into trying, especially for those who build things for these platforms
          every day. Everyone wants to be the one with the insight, the one who
          sees what others can't. It's interesting to me, though, how every time
          something new is announced, the default reaction is to predict
          failure.

          There are plenty of reasons to believe that the Vision Pro might not
          live up to the hype. At $3500, it's inaccessible to most people. The
          feature set is not all that different from an iPad. Sure, the
          experience of using the device may be unique, but is it $3500 unique?
          And then there's the battery life, coming in at just 2 hours, and the
          potential for social discomfort reminiscent of the Google Glass
          debacle. Add to that the fact that it doesn't appear to be
          particularly geared toward fitness or gaming, and the prospect of
          donning a headset to capture and relive memories might strike some as
          downright dystopian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we write off the Vision Pro as a doomed venture, let's take a
          moment to consider Apple's track record. This is a company that has
          consistently taken niche markets and propelled them into the
          mainstream. They did it with the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad,
          and the Apple Watch. Each time, they've met with overwhelming success.
          Apple is one of the richest companies in history, with a record of
          calculated moves backed by massive R&amp;D investment. Just think:
          Does our 24 hours' worth of experience really outweigh the years of
          Apple research?
        </p>
        <p>
          When you look at it in the context of Apple's previous product
          launches, the Vision Pro doesn't seem all that outlandish. The Apple
          Watch launched at $450, the iPad at $700, and the iPhone at $900, all
          adjusted for inflation. Hell, the original Mac was released for the
          equivalent of $7,400 today. The money in VR is there too. In just a
          year, Facebook saw its non-advertising revenue jump from $346 million
          to $885 million. And that was three years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Apple Watch is anything to go by, we can expect the Vision Pro
          to evolve over time. Originally, the Apple Watch was marketed as a
          luxury product with a handful of communication and fitness features
          instead of the $250 health and safety product it is now. As
          third-party developers get their hands on the Vision Pro, I'm sure
          we'll see its uses and value proposition expand and shift in ways we
          can't expect. Right now, the only people who will really be buying
          this are early adopters who will use it like Apple is dictating now.
          Until the price comes down and everyday consumers normalize being
          immersed in some intangible 3D space, we won't truly understand its
          potential. Remember when we were still receiving AOL CDs? Who could've
          predicted the rise of Instagram, TikTok, or Uber back then?
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech industry is ever-evolving. It's not always the obvious
          features that shape our world, but the surprising and unpredictable
          ways in which we use them.
